Note: 
Linux systems are designed with robust security, and bypassing the root password without authorization is illegal and unethical. However, if you have legitimate access to the machine (e.g., a server or computer you own), you can reset the root password using the following steps. These are primarily for system recovery purposes:

Reset Root Password on Linux
1. Boot into GRUB
•	Restart your system.
•	Press and hold the Shift key (or Esc on some systems) during boot to access the GRUB menu.
2. Edit GRUB Boot Parameters
•	In the GRUB menu, highlight your Linux OS entry (usually the default option) and press e to edit.
•	Look for the line starting with linux or linux16 (depending on your Linux distribution).
•	At the end of this line, replace ro (read-only mode) with rw (read-write mode) and append: 
•	init=/bin/bash
3. Boot into Single-User Mode
•	Press Ctrl+X or F10 to boot with the modified parameters. This will load a minimal shell as the root user.
4. Reset the Root Password
•	Remount the root filesystem with write permissions if necessary: 
•	mount -o remount,rw /
•	Reset the root password by running: 
•	passwd
•	Enter and confirm the new password.
5. Update SELinux Contexts (Optional)
•	If SELinux is enabled, update the context to avoid boot errors: 
•	touch /.autorelabel
6. Reboot the System
•	Reboot the system to apply changes: 
•	exec /sbin/init

Important Notes
•	Authorized Use Only: This guide is intended for legitimate recovery purposes (e.g., forgotten root password).
•	Server Context: For remote servers, physical access or access to recovery tools like rescue mode may be needed.
•	Audit Logs: All Linux systems log activity. Ensure you have permission to make changes.

For simple command:
go to grub interface and press "e" 
Look for the line starting with linux or linux16 (depending on your Linux distribution). write 'rd.break' and press ctrl + X
write - mount -0 remount,rw/sysroot
reset password , command- passwd
touch /.autorelabel
and exit the directory and reboot
