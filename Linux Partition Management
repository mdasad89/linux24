Linux Partition Management
Linux Partition Management
When installing the RHEL 9 operating system, four (4) partitions are created by default. The size of these partitions is specified as follows:
1.	/boot/efi: 200 MiB (Required for GPT-based partitions).
2.	/boot: 1024 MiB.
3.	/: 20 GiB.
4.	swap: 2 GiB.
To view all system partitions, use the following command:
[root@desktop ~]# lsblk  
Example output:
sda      8:0    0   30G  0 disk  
├─sda1   8:1    0  200M  0 part /boot/efi  
├─sda2   8:2    0    1G  0 part /boot  
├─sda3   8:3    0   20G  0 part /  
└─sda4   8:4    0    2G  0 part [SWAP]

Partition Table Structure
Linux and Windows systems use two types of partition tables:
1.	MBR (Master Boot Record):
o	Used with BIOS/Legacy firmware.
o	Referred to as "dos" in Linux.
2.	GPT (GUID Partition Table):
o	Used with UEFI firmware.
o	Referred to as "gpt" in Linux.
Partition Table Comparison:
•	MBR: 32-bit, supports up to 2 TB (512-byte sectors).
•	GPT: 64-bit, supports up to 9.4 ZB (512-byte sectors).

Why Partition a Disk?
Disk partitioning separates the system's operating system and user/application data into distinct partitions. This provides the following benefits:
•	Data Safety: In case of partition failure or crash, data on other partitions remains unaffected.
________________________________________
File System Formats
Each operating system uses specific file system formats for partitions.
•	Windows File Systems: NTFS, FAT32.
o	NTFS: Supports advanced features like security, encryption, compression, and larger file/partition sizes.
o	FAT32: Simpler, but limited to 32 GB maximum partition size.
•	Linux File Systems: ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS (current standard), vfat, swap, GFS2, ZFS (BSD).
o	EXT4: Supports up to 50 TB.
o	XFS: Supports up to 1 PB.

Linux Device File Naming Conventions:
•	HDD/SSD (IDE/SATA/SAS/SCSI): /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc.
•	NVMe Drives: /dev/nvme0n1.
•	Virtual Disks: /dev/vda, /dev/vdb.
•	USB Drives: /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb1.
•	DVD Drives: /dev/sr0.

Creating and Managing Partitions
Linux provides tools like fdisk, parted, and cfdisk for disk partitioning.
Example: Creating a New Partition with fdisk:
1.	List available partitions:
2.	fdisk -l  
3.	Start partitioning:
4.	fdisk /dev/sda  
5.	Use the following commands during partitioning:
•	n: Create a new partition.
•	d: Delete a partition.
•	t: Change the partition type.
•	p: Display current partitions.
•	w: Save changes and write to the disk.
•	q: Quit without saving.
6.	Example of creating a 300 MiB partition:
•	Command: n
•	Partition number: 5 (or default).
•	First sector: Press Enter (default).
•	Last sector: +300M.
Result:
Created a new partition 5 of type 'Linux filesystem' and size 300 MiB.
